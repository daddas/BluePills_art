An modified art library source.

Currently works with Android Q.

Might be integrated to higher or lower versions.


NOTE:
  
  Semi-xposed classes are defined in framework.jar.

  Thus, build from source required, due to method injection timings.
  
  Dangeous hacking may cause system crash at boot-phase.
